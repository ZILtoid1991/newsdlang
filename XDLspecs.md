XDL (Extendible Declarative Language) is a declarative language built upon the SDLang (Simple Declarative Language) specification.

# Main differences

* Single integer type and single floating-point type only. Distinction is done via the decimal point, API provides automatic conversions from and to the target types.
* More formatting options for numeric types (underscores, hexadecimal, etc.).
* ISO 8601 support, dropping of SDLang's own datetime formatting.
* Standardization of how brace styles and semicolons work.
